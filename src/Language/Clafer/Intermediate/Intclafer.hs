For IFunExp standard set of operators includes:
1. Unary operators:

        #          -- set counting operator
        -          -- negation (arithmetic)
        max        -- maximum (created for goals)
        min        -- minimum (created for goals)
2. Binary operators:
        <=>        -- equivalence
        =>         -- implication
        ||         -- disjunction
        xor        -- exclusive or
        &&         -- conjunction
        <          -- less than
        >          -- greater than
        =          -- equality
        <=         -- less than or equal
        >=         -- greater than or equal
        !=         -- inequality
